- **Column Selection**: Use the "View" dropdown (usually represented by an eye icon or similar) to show or hide specific columns in the table.
- **Pagination**: If there are many users, use the pagination controls at the top-right to navigate through pages and adjust the number of users shown per page.
- **Sorting**: Click on the column headers for "Name" or "Email" to sort the user list accordingly (ascending/descending).

## Users Table

The main part of the page is a table listing the active users with the following default columns:

- **Name**: Displays the user's avatar and full name. Clicking on the user's name navigates to their **[User Profile](./user-profile.md)** page.
- **Email**: Displays the user's registered email address.
- **Projects**: Displays the count of projects the user is currently assigned to. Hovering over or clicking the number may show the list of projects.
