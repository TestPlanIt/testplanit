This page provides a comprehensive view of a single test case within your project's repository.

## Case Information

The main section displays key details about the test case:

*   **Title:** The name of the test case.
*   **Description:** Detailed steps or information about the test case. This field supports Markdown for rich text formatting.
*   **Repository:** The repository this case belongs to.
*   **Folder:** The specific folder within the repository where the case resides (if applicable).
*   **Template:** The template used for this test case, defining its custom fields.
*   **Estimate:** The manually set estimated time (in seconds) required to execute the test case. See [Duration Display](./#duration-display) below for formatting.
*   **Forecast:** An automatically calculated prediction (in seconds) of how long the test case will take to execute. See [Forecast Calculation](./#forecast-calculation) below for details.
*   **Priority:** The priority level assigned to the test case.
*   **Tags:** Any tags associated with the test case for organization and filtering.
*   **Created:** Timestamp indicating when the test case was created.
*   **Updated:** Timestamp indicating the last time the test case was modified.
*   **Custom Fields:** Any additional fields defined by the selected template will be displayed here.

## Duration Display

Both the `Estimate` and `Forecast` fields store time in seconds but are displayed in a human-readable format (e.g., "5 minutes, 30 seconds", "1 hour, 2 minutes"). If no time is recorded (value is 0 or null), it displays "No time recorded".

## Forecast Calculation

The `Forecast` value provides an automated prediction of the test case's execution time. It is distinct from the manually entered `Estimate`.

*   **Calculation:** The forecast is calculated by averaging the `elapsed` time recorded in all associated **Test Run Results** for this specific test case. Results with `null` or `0` elapsed time are excluded from the average.
*   **Updates:** This calculation is performed automatically by a background job that runs once daily (typically overnight).
*   **Read-Only:** The forecast value is system-generated and cannot be edited directly by users. It serves as a data-driven insight into expected execution duration based on historical performance.
*   **Display:** It is shown on the Test Case Details page and can be added as a column in the main [Repository View](./repository.md).

## Versions

The **Versions** tab shows the history of changes made to this test case. Each entry represents a saved version, allowing you to track modifications over time.

*   **Timestamp:** When the version was saved.
*   **Author:** The user who made the change.
*   **Changes:** A summary or link to view the specific differences between versions (details depend on implementation).

This feature is crucial for auditing and understanding the evolution of a test case. You can often revert to or compare with previous versions if needed (depending on system capabilities).
