# Installation

This section guides you through setting up TestPlanIt for local development.

Choose the method that best suits your environment:

- **[Manual Setup](manual-setup.md)**: Recommended if you prefer to manage Node.js, pnpm, and PostgreSQL directly on your host machine.
- **[Docker Setup (Development)](docker-setup.md)**: Recommended for a simpler, containerized setup where Docker manages the application and database environment.

After completing either setup guide, proceed to the **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** guide for a quick tour of the application.
