We're excited to announce TestPlanIt v0.9.14, focused on improving your daily workflow with **rich text editor enhancements**, a **new repository column**, and **streamlined folder navigation**.

## Rich Text Editor Drag Handles

Reorganizing test case documentation just got easier. The Tiptap editor now includes a **ContentItemMenu** with drag handles, allowing you to drag and reorder content blocks within your test case descriptions, preconditions, and other rich text fields.

Simply hover over any content block to reveal the drag handle, then drag it to reposition the content exactly where you need it.

## "Last Test Result" Column

A new column in the repository view shows the **most recent test result status** for each test case at a glance. No more digging through test runs to find out when a case was last executed.

- See the status indicator directly in the repository table
- Hover to view when the test was executed and which test run it was part of
- Quickly identify test cases that haven't been run recently

## Keyboard Shortcut for New Folders

Press **Shift+N** to instantly open the Add Folder dialog from anywhere in the repository view. This small addition makes organizing your test cases faster than ever.

## Folder Tree Improvements

We've made several enhancements to the folder tree navigation:

- **Click anywhere to expand/collapse** - No need to precisely click the chevron icon anymore. Click anywhere on a folder row to toggle it open or closed.
- **Alt+click for bulk expand/collapse** - Alt+click (Option+click on Mac) on any root folder to expand or collapse ALL root folders at once. Great for getting a quick overview or cleaning up a cluttered view.
- **Bottom drop zone** - Drag folders to the new drop zone at the bottom of the tree to move them to the root level.
- **Auto-selection** - Newly created folders are automatically selected and the URL updates, so you can immediately start adding test cases.

## Flexible Folder Creation

When creating a new folder, you can now **override the parent folder** and create it at the root level instead. This is useful when you have a subfolder selected but want to quickly create a new top-level folder without changing your selection first.
