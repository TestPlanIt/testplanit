We're excited to announce TestPlanIt v0.4.0, introducing **Magic Select**—AI-powered test case selection that helps teams work smarter when creating test runs.

## Magic Select: Let AI Choose Your Test Cases

Creating a test run often means manually selecting which test cases to include—a time-consuming process that can lead to missed coverage or unnecessary tests. Magic Select changes that.

### How It Works

When creating a test run, click the **Magic Select** button and let AI analyze:

- Your test run name and description
- Project documentation
- Tags and linked issues
- Historical test data

The AI then suggests the most relevant test cases for your specific testing goal.

### Getting Started with Magic Select

1. Navigate to **Test Runs** and click **Add Test Run**
2. Fill in your test run details (name, description, milestone)
3. Click the **Magic Select** button
4. Review the AI-suggested test cases
5. Adjust selections if needed and save

Magic Select requires an LLM integration configured in your project settings. We support OpenAI, Anthropic, and other popular providers.
