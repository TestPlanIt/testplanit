We're excited to announce TestPlanIt v0.10.0. This version brings **four new pre-built reports**, **enhanced version management**, **smooth UI transitions**, and dozens of improvements to make your testing workflow more efficient.

## New Pre-Built Reports

v0.10.0 introduces four powerful pre-built reports that provide immediate insights into your testing program.

### Test Case Health Report

Monitor the health of your test repository with a dedicated report that identifies:

- **Stale test cases** that haven't been executed recently (configurable threshold)
- **Execution frequency** to understand which tests are actively maintained
- **Pass rate trends** for cases with sufficient execution history
- **Lookback period** filtering to focus on recent activity

This report helps you identify test cases that may need updating, removal, or more frequent execution.

### Issue Test Coverage Report

Understand your test coverage from the perspective of tracked issues:

- **Linked test cases** per issue showing coverage breadth
- **Untested count** to identify issues lacking automated test coverage
- **Execution status** of linked tests (passed, failed, not executed)
- **Bubble chart visualization** for quick identification of coverage gaps

Perfect for ensuring critical issues have adequate test coverage before releases.

### Automation Trends Report

Track your test automation progress over time:

- **Automation rate trends** showing the percentage of automated vs. manual tests
- **Test case growth** visualizing repository expansion
- **Execution velocity** metrics for CI/CD performance tracking
- **Time-series analysis** to monitor automation adoption

### Flaky Tests Report

Identify unreliable tests that pass and fail inconsistently:

- **Flakiness percentage** based on historical execution patterns
- **Impact analysis** showing how often flaky tests block builds
- **Recent execution history** for each flagged test
- **Priority ranking** to help you fix the most disruptive flaky tests first

## Client-Side Sorting

Issues and Tags views now support client-side sorting for better performance:

- **Test case count** per tag/issue
- **Test run associations**
- **Session references**
- **Project linkages**

The sorting logic provides instant feedback without server round trips, maintaining pagination state during sort operations.

## Import & Data Handling Improvements

### Multi-Select Field Support

Enhanced handling of multi-select custom fields:

- **Array value consistency** across all components
- **Proper mapping** of option names to IDs during import
- **Render field updates** ensuring values are treated as arrays
- **Field value renderer** improvements for both single and multi-select scenarios

### Import Route Enhancements

The bulk import functionality now:

- Correctly maps option names to IDs for both select types
- Includes conditional `externalId` handling for issues
- Improves data integrity during large imports
- Adds helpful comments for maintainability

## E2E Test Infrastructure

Major improvements to the end-to-end test suite:

### Enhanced API Helpers

New methods added to `ApiHelper`:

```typescript
// Status and milestone assignment
assignStatusesToProject(projectId: number)
assignMilestoneTypesToProject(projectId: number)

// Field management
getCaseFieldId(displayName: string)
assignFieldToTemplate(templateId: number, fieldId: number)

// Template verification
verifyTemplate(templateName: string)

// Step management
addStepsToTestCase(caseId: number, steps: Array)
```

### Improved Caching

- **Map-based caching** for template, state, and repository IDs
- **Project-specific cache keys** preventing cross-contamination
- **Reduced API calls** through intelligent cache lookups
- **Better error handling** when cached items are missing

### Test Isolation

Tests now ensure proper isolation through:

- Dynamic template creation per test
- Automatic status/milestone assignment
- Field assignment verification
- Polling for cascade updates with configurable timeouts

## Additional Improvements

### Project Creation Wizard

- **Updated step titles** for better localization support
- **Enhanced default values** for milestone types
- **Improved button accessibility** throughout the wizard
- **Better styling consistency** across all steps

### Repository UI

- **Add test case link** when repository is empty
- **Conditional case field rendering** based on edit mode

### Overflow Detection

The `TextFromJson` component now:

- Uses **ResizeObserver** for accurate overflow detection
- Shows expand buttons only when content actually overflows
- Handles dynamic content changes gracefully
- Provides better visual feedback

## Bug Fixes

This release includes fixes for:

- Multi-select field value handling in imports
- TOTP verification async/await patterns
- Step data stringification before API calls
- Loading state handling in custom field tests
- Default template cascade update verification
- Transaction mocks in bulk-edit tests
