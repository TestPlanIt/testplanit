## Two-Factor Authentication: Secure Your Account

Security is paramount for test management systems that handle sensitive project data. TestPlanIt now supports two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of protection beyond your password.

### Key Features

**TOTP-Based Authentication**

- Works with any authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.)
- Scan a QR code or enter the secret key manually
- Time-based one-time passwords for secure verification

**Backup Codes**

- Receive backup codes when enabling 2FA
- Use backup codes if you lose access to your authenticator app
- Regenerate codes at any time from your profile settings

**Administrative Controls**

- Require 2FA for all users with password logins
- Enforce 2FA across all authentication methods (including SSO)
- Monitor 2FA status across your organization

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

1. Navigate to your **Profile Settings**
2. Find the **Two-Factor Authentication** section
3. Click **Enable 2FA**
4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
5. Enter the verification code to confirm
6. Save your backup codes in a secure location

### For Administrators

Administrators can enforce 2FA requirements from **Admin → SSO Settings**:

- **Require for password logins**: Users with password-based authentication must enable 2FA
- **Require for all logins**: All users, including those using SSO, must enable 2FA

For detailed documentation, see our [Two-Factor Authentication Guide](/docs/user-guide/two-factor-authentication).
