We're excited to announce TestPlanIt v0.7.0, bringing **automated test results import** from seven popular testing frameworks, making it easier than ever to integrate your CI/CD pipelines with TestPlanIt.

## Import Automated Test Results from Any Framework

Whether you're running Java tests with JUnit, .NET tests with NUnit, or JavaScript tests with Mocha, TestPlanIt now supports importing test results from all major testing frameworks.

### Supported Formats

| Format | File Types | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **JUnit XML** | `.xml` | Java, Python (pytest), and many CI systems |
| **TestNG XML** | `.xml` | Java projects using TestNG |
| **NUnit XML** | `.xml` | .NET projects using NUnit v2/v3 |
| **xUnit XML** | `.xml` | .NET projects using xUnit.net |
| **MSTest TRX** | `.trx`, `.xml` | Visual Studio Test Results |
| **Mocha JSON** | `.json` | JavaScript/Node.js projects |
| **Cucumber JSON** | `.json` | BDD frameworks (Cucumber, SpecFlow) |

### Smart Auto-Detection

Don't worry about selecting the right format. TestPlanIt's auto-detect feature examines your file content and automatically identifies the format. Just upload your test results and let TestPlanIt handle the rest.

### Automatic Test Case Creation

When you import test results, TestPlanIt automatically:

- **Creates test cases** or maps to existing test cases for each test in the report
- **Organizes tests into folders** based on namespace/package structure
- **Applies templates** to imported test cases
- **Maps result statuses** (passed, failed, error, skipped) to TestPlanIt statuses

### Real-Time Progress Updates

The new import dialog shows real-time progress as your results are processed, so you always know exactly what's happening during the import.

## CI/CD Integration

Integrate TestPlanIt with your existing CI/CD pipelines using the new import API:

```bash
curl -X POST "${TESTPLANIT_URL}/api/test-results/import" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TESTPLANIT_TOKEN}" \
    -F "files=@test-results.xml" \
    -F "name=Build ${BUILD_NUMBER}" \
    -F "projectId=${PROJECT_ID}" \
    -F "format=auto"
```

See our [Import & Export documentation](/docs/import-export#cicd-pipeline-integration) for complete examples with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI systems.
