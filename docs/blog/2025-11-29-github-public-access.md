# TestPlanIt Source Code is Now Available to Everyone

After 2 years of development, I'm thrilled to announce that TestPlanIt is now available on GitHub for anyone to download, install, and use.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why Open Source?

Test case management tools have traditionally been expensive, proprietary solutions that lock teams into rigid workflows. I wanted to change that.

By releasing TestPlanIt as open source, you can:

- **Self-host** on your own infrastructure with full control over your data
- **Customize** the platform to fit your team's specific workflows
- **Contribute** improvements and features back to the community
- **Audit** the code for security and compliance requirements

## Get Started Today

Getting TestPlanIt running is straightforward:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/testplanit/testplanit.git
cd testplanit
pnpm install
```

For detailed setup including database configuration and Docker deployment options, check out our [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).

## What's Next?

With the source code now public, I'm looking forward to:

- Hearing feedback from the community
- Reviewing contributions and pull requests
- Continuing to add features based on real-world usage
