We're excited to announce TestPlanIt v0.11.0, introducing **Share Links** - a new feature for securely sharing reports with team members, clients, and stakeholders without requiring them to have a TestPlanIt account.

## Share Links

Share Links enable you to distribute reports through secure, customizable URLs with three access modes:

### Access Modes

**Authenticated Mode**

- Requires login with project access
- Full interactive experience with all report features
- Best for internal stakeholders and sensitive data

**Public Mode**

- No authentication required
- Read-only view with filtered data (emails and IDs removed)
- Perfect for public dashboards and transparency reports

**Password-Protected Mode**

- Requires password to access
- Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Auth bypass for logged-in team members
- Ideal for client reports and confidential sharing

### Configuration Options

- **Custom titles and descriptions**
- **Expiration dates** for time-limited access
- **Password protection** with bcrypt hashing
- **Notify on view** to receive notifications when accessed
- **Project or cross-project** sharing

### Access Management

Manage shares from three locations:

- Project Settings → Shares
- Admin Panel → Shares (cross-project view)
- Share Dialog → "My Shares" tab

Available actions:

- Copy share URLs to clipboard
- Edit titles, descriptions, passwords, and expiration dates
- Toggle notifications on/off
- Revoke or delete shares

### Access Analytics

**View Tracking**

- View counter per share
- Last viewed timestamp
- Session-based tracking

**Access Logs**

- Viewer name/email or "Anonymous"
- IP address and user agent
- Access timestamp
- Authentication status

**Notifications**

- In App/Email notifications when links are accessed
- Includes viewer info and access timestamp
- Toggle on/off anytime

### Security Features

- 256-bit entropy share keys (43 characters)
- Bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- Rate limiting on password attempts
- Automatic expiration and revocation enforcement
- Data filtering for public shares
- Complete audit logging
- Multi-tenant security
