# Release Please Workflow
#
# This workflow automates releases using release-please.
# It creates/updates a release PR when commits are pushed to main,
# and creates GitHub releases + tags when the PR is merged.
#
# How it works:
# 1. On every push to main, release-please analyzes commits since the last release
# 2. If there are releasable changes, it creates/updates a Release PR with:
#    - Version bump in package.json
#    - Updated CHANGELOG.md
# 3. When the Release PR is merged, release-please:
#    - Creates a GitHub Release
#    - Creates a git tag (e.g., v0.1.35)
# 4. The tag push triggers the existing release.yml workflow for Docker builds
