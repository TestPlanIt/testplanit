# Package Release Workflow
#
# This workflow handles versioning and publishing of @testplanit/* packages to npm.
# It uses Changesets to manage versions and changelogs.
#
# How it works:
# 1. When PRs with changesets are merged to main, this workflow runs
# 2. It creates/updates a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps and changelog updates
# 3. When the "Version Packages" PR is merged, packages are published to npm
#
# To release:
# 1. Create a changeset: pnpm changeset
# 2. Commit and merge to main
# 3. Review and merge the auto-created "Version Packages" PR
#
