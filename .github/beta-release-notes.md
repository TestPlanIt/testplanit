**Beta pre-release of TestPlanIt 1.0 — source only.**

There is no prebuilt Docker image for betas: official images bake
`BASE_DOMAIN=testplanit.com` into the build and can't be reused by other
installs. You build it yourself from the source attached below.

> ⚠️ This is pre-release software. **Back up your database before trying it.**

### Try it

1. Download **Source code (zip / tar.gz)** from the Assets below (or
   `git checkout` this tag).
2. Configure your environment:
   ```bash
   cp testplanit/.env.example testplanit/.env.production   # then fill in values
   ```
3. Build and run (the compose file builds from source):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f testplanit/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
   ```
   Serving multiple subdomains off one image? Build with your own wildcard:
   `--build-arg BASE_DOMAIN=<your-domain>`.
4. **Upgrading an existing database?** v3 uses versioned migrations. Run the
   one-time baseline **before** first boot, then start normally (the container
   applies the rest on startup):
   ```bash
   cd testplanit
   npx zenstack migrate resolve --applied 20260625193632_init --schema schema.zmodel
   ```
